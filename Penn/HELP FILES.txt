@@ TECHNICAL - Extra
&HLP`PUEBLO [u(cobj,help)]=Pueblo is an extra feature that lets Pueblo-compatible clients support special text features. Namely, clicking on text that shows up on your screen.%R%R[mudname()] is a Pueblo-enhanced world. While it is hardly necessary, it is nevertheless handy.%R%RPueblo-enabled clients are rare, however. For Windows, there is MUSHclient and the old original Pueblo.%R%RMUSHclient enables Pueblo by default. It can be turned off or otherwise modified by going to your client's configuration. In MUSHclient, that's Game > Configure > MXP/Pueblo (also accessible via ctrl+alt+U).%R%RWe highly recommend turning off local echo text and custom link colors as we use our own colors and otherwise all you will see is hyperlink blue.%R%RPueblo is detected and enabled upon connection to the MUSH. If you change whether it is on or off in your client, you will not see the results until you disconnect and reconnect that character.%R%RMXP Menus are used when available. PennMUSH does not natively support MXP and it identifies itself as Pueblo-compatible to clients, but MUSHclient will still see and render MXP SEND tags properly.

&HLP`CONNECTIONTROUBLES [u(cobj,help)]=Every now and then, someone joins the game who might have problems staying connected. The following advice will help you if that problem matches this symptom: you type nothing for a minute or two, and the game stops sending you text-- when you type something, it suddenly says you're disconnected.%r%rThis is a problem typical of those behind NAT (Network Address Translation)... in other words, routers and large networks.%r%rTo solve this problem:%r%r[ansi(h,@set me=KEEPALIVE)]%rThis will tell the game to work harder to keep the connection to your character open. There is also the option of setting a timer in your client (check your client's Help files for instructions on doing so) that sends IDLE (all capitals! iDLE or idle will not work) to the game every minute or two.%r%rThis will only solve problems related to a lack of activity causing the hardware to invisibly disconnect you. There are some problems it cannot solve.%R%RTo PROPERLY leave the game. type QUIT

&HLP`WIDTH [u(cobj,help)]=This game makes use of Dynamic Width displays. The server uses a special telnet feature called NAWS to determine the width of your client. If, for some reason, you are having trouble with widths or want to specify your width directly, check help width and help SCREENWIDTH for instructions.
