CHANGELOG: 3.1

SCENESYS:
* +scene/edit now properly documented. it uses ^^^ to split before/after, just like +bbedit.
* +scene/joins are now timestamped. Timestamps older than 8h are invalidated. This is to prevent posing to the wrong scene two days later by accident.
* +scene/start and +scene/continue now link the room to the scene. To log a scene you must be in said room. This means only one scene can ever be active in a location at a time. Again, to prevent accidental cross-scene logging.
* +scene/upcoming aka +events, +Scenes, etc, now shows an empty day for today if there are no scenes today. This should make it easier to not mistake tomorrow for today, etc.
* +scene/old now displays the scene's creation date instead of its finish date, as the latter might be wildly inaccurate.
* Several fixes to the way scene data is created and handled. 

ACCOUNT:
* +account/options MAIL option now works properly.

BBS:
* The Mandatory board alert system now functions properly.
* +bbadmin/create now gives output on a success.
* +bbadmin/create works properly for setting default permissions now.
* +help bbs/admin is now accurate.
* +bbread/# now works for pagifying properly.

GROUP:
* GBADMIN permission in default rank data renamed to BBADMIN. It was already supposed to be this, I just forgot.
* +help Groups/Membership now explains Group Titles.
* Group RADIO setting now processes kicks properly.
* Added +group/options with the ability to make +group <target> change focus.

GUESTS:
* Guests are no longer automatically added to 'CHANNELS_PLAYERS' list by the Account System.
* Guest creation now works properly.

GRID:
* +district/subcreate no longer gives display errors.
* +shelp +district now displays properly. Pesky commas!

JOBS:
+job/newbucket now sets default permissions properly.

MEETME:
* Displays now use the proper character (target, not enactor!) for figuring out width/color/formatting.

SCENESYS:
* Now respects @lock/speech properly.

THEME aka FCLIST:
* +Theme/status now works properly.

TECHNICAL/MISC:
* Removed the vol_game_config legacy function.
* SQL Schema no longer uses nested Stored Procedures due to incompatability with PennMUSH's sql connection. Simply re-run the Schema.sql file to fix.
